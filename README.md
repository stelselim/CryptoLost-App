## Domain-Driven Design
Domain-driven design is a concept in order structure software projects and maintain the domain layer of the source code by [Eric Evans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericevansddd/). For further reading, [here](https://www.domainlanguage.com/ddd/). DDD is robust, solid & be applicable to various fields of software development. Thanks to DDD, massive projects are much maintainable with its principles. 

## Flutter with DDD
In Flutter development, DDD might be used with different state management libraries; such as BLOC, provider, redux... This project uses Provider. The directory of the project is mainly seperated into 4 subdirectories: Application, Domain, Presentation, Infrastructure. Each subdirectory has a valuable role in DDD. Every one of them should be considered as a layer of a building. Some layers contact other layers, some do not.
